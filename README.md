An tiny implementation of [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).

Many features will be cut:
* CUDA/HIP
* OpenMP and other accelerators
* Parallelazation
* Python support
* and so on

Some core conponent will be kept
* Tensor/Storage and its Ops
* Dispatch
* Computation Graph
* Autograd
* and so on

Notice:
As a learning project, to save time, a lot of code is copied from [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
